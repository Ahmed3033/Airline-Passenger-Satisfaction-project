# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-project
full data science project with EDA, ML, advanced visualizations and deployment

Overview

This project explores a dataset containing an airline passenger satisfaction survey. The goal is to analyze factors highly correlated with passenger satisfaction and develop a predictive model for passenger satisfaction prediction.




Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

Features: Various factors such as seat comfort, inflight entertainment, cleanliness, departure/arrival time convenience, etc.

Target Variable: Passenger satisfaction (satisfied/dissatisfied).

.

Objectives

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify key factors correlated with passenger satisfaction.

Visualize relationships between different features and satisfaction levels.

Predictive Modeling:

Build machine learning models to predict passenger satisfaction.

Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing model.
